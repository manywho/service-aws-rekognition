This service allows you to integrate your flows with the AWS Rekognition API.

### Building

To build the application, you will need to have Maven 3 and a Java 8 implementation installed (OpenJDK and Oracle Java SE
are both supported).

Now you can build the runnable shaded JAR:

```bash
$ mvn clean package
```

### Running

The application is a RestEASY JAX-RS application, that by default is run under the Jetty server on port 8080 (if you
use the packaged JAR).

#### Defaults

Running the following command will start the service listening on `0.0.0.0:8080`:

```bash
$ java -jar target/service-rekognition.jar
```
